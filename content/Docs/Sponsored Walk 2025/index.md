<h2>Itinerary</h2>

<strong>Registration</strong> 9:00am – 9:55am at the Piazza (John Macintosh Square).

We recommend that you take part in the Stretch Classes conducted by our Founder - Jayne Wink, before we set off on our 25 Km Walk.

<strong>Set off at 10am.</strong>
Please bring your Passports and ID Cards and water for the route to Alcaidesa.

<strong>Gibraltar Route</strong> – Proceeding from John Macintosh Square, we will walk along through Main Street to Casemates and go through the tunnel towards Laguna Estate.
Continue walking along the right pavement of Winston Churchill Avenue due North and cross Devil’s Tower Rd. by the petrol station.
We will cross the Airport Runway towards Spain.

<strong>Spanish Route</strong> – After passing Spanish Passport & Customs at the Frontier, we will assemble at the exit car park and ensure that all the registered walkers are together.

We will go along Calle Gibraltar to the junction with Ave. del Ejercito towards the eastern side. Go along Calle Torijos to Paseo del Mediterraneo (which is the pedestrian walkway along the beach) going all along Calle Santa Maria to Calle Canarias (just after the little church). Cutting through Calle Canarias we will walk
on the pedestrian walkway all along Camino Sobrevela (this is the pedestrian walkway along the beach).

We will have a very short break here, to allow stragglers to catch up and for all walkers to drink some water.

At the end of Camino Sobrevela the road joins the junction of the start of Avenida del Burgo, we cross it into a path and walk along it to meet up with Camino Estepona.

This takes us all the way to Alcaidesa. We will finish the first leg of our Sponsored Walk at the One Eden Chiringuito, at the beach in Alcaidesa.

We will rest for one hour for a toilet stop and have refreshments. We have made arrangements at the One Eden Chiringuito and reserved beach barrels and stools for 20 persons on the sand at the Chiringuito.
