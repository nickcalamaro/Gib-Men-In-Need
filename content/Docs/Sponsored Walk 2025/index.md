<h1>Itinerary</h1>

<strong>Registration</strong> 9:00am – 9:55am at the Piazza (John Macintosh Square).

We recommend that you take part in the Stretch Classes conducted by our Founder - Jayne Wink, before we set off on our 25 Km Walk.

<strong>Set off at 10am.</strong>
Please bring your Passports and ID Cards and water for the route to Alcaidesa.

<strong>Gibraltar Route</strong> – Proceeding from John Macintosh Square, we will walk along through Main Street to Casemates and go through the tunnel towards Laguna Estate.
Continue walking along the right pavement of Winston Churchill Avenue due North and cross Devil’s Tower Rd. by the petrol station.
We will cross the Airport Runway towards Spain.

<strong>Spanish Route</strong> – After passing Spanish Passport & Customs at the Frontier, we will assemble at the exit car park and ensure that all the registered walkers are together.

We will go along Calle Gibraltar to the junction with Ave. del Ejercito towards the eastern side. Go along Calle Torijos to Paseo del Mediterraneo (which is the pedestrian walkway along the beach) going all along Calle Santa Maria to Calle Canarias (just after the little church). Cutting through Calle Canarias we will walk on the pedestrian walkway all along Camino Sobrevela (this is the pedestrian walkway along the beach). 
At the end of Camino Sobrevela the road joins the junction of the start of  Avenida del Burgo, we cross it into a path and walk along it to meet up with Camino Estepona. 
This takes us all the way to Alcaidesa. We will finish the first leg of our Sponsored Walk at the car park of Avenida de la Hacienda by La Vista Beach Bar/Restaurant.

We will rest for one hour for a toilet stop and have refreshments.

The return leg back to Gibraltar will retrace our journey but this time stopping at Casemates where the Walkers will be addressed and thanked by Jayne Wink.
