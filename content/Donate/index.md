    Men in Need is a Gibraltar‐based charity registered as Charity Number 364. We are dedicated to providing comprehensive and empathetic support to men experiencing a range of challenges throughout Gibraltar.

    By working directly with the Ministry of Justice and collaborating closely with key government departments—including the Ministry for Housing and the Ministry for Employment—we have built a trusted network that connects men to essential services. Although we do not offer direct employment or housing opportunities, our role is to effectively facilitate access to a variety of critical support services.
